I'm a multilingual machine learning engineer and certified data scientist, with three years of experience in data science and an interdisciplinary educational background in renewable energy and environmental engineering.

ðŸ˜„ Current interests: AI for social good, climate change mitigation and adaptation research, environmental intelligence, renewable energy, and sustainability-related data science projects

ðŸŒ± As a lifelong learner with a growth mindset, I seek opportunities to learn new skills every day. Realizing the rising importance of big data in getting insights, telling stories, and finding solutions for the world's problems, I continue to learn various things related to data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to explore how they can be leveraged for social good and sustainability enhancements. 
Currently holding a Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certificate from Google Cloud, Cloud Developer - Associate from AWS, Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity, Azure Data Scientist Associate from Microsoft, and a Data Science Professional Certificate from IBM, I also like learning about other topics, from design thinking to innovation management.

ðŸ’¬ Skills:

- Data science/analytics/visualization: Python, pyspark, Power BI, Tableau, D3.js
- Machine learning: scikit-learn, Tensorflow
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Cloud computing: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), AWS, Azure
- Others: git and GitHub, PowerShell, bash

ðŸ”­ I also have six years of experience in a managerial position at a multinational company, where I worked with 30 departments in four different countries, reduced costs in our environmental projects by 60%, and initiated 15+ new programs; and a few years in sustainability consulting, working mostly in impact assessment and environmental data analysis.

âœ¨ My extensive experience of working in an international environment and passion for learning foreign languages & cultures have also enhanced my intercultural sensitivity.

âš¡ When not at work, I'll be traveling with my family, learning new languages, reading, writing rap songs, or playing basketball.
  I also enjoy participating in DS/ML/AI competitions/hackathons with my fellow ladies at AI Wonder Girls.
