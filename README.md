I am a multilingual environmental sustainability consultant and certified data scientist, with an interdisciplinary educational background in renewable energy, environmental engineering, and practical skills in machine learning.

ðŸ”­ In the past three years, I've been in sustainability consulting, working mostly in impact assessment and environmental data analysis. I also have six years of experience in a managerial position at a multinational company, where I worked with 30 departments in four different countries, reduced costs in our environmental projects by 60%, and initiated 15+ new programs.

ðŸ˜„ Current interests: environmental intelligence, sustainability, renewable energy, climate change mitigation and adaptation research, and data science projects

ðŸŒ± As a lifelong learner with a growth mindset, I seek opportunities to learn new skills every day. Realizing the rising importance of big data in getting insights, telling stories, and finding solutions for environmental sustainability problems of the world, I learned data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to explore how they can be leveraged for sustainability enhancements. Recently attained a Nanodegree in Machine Learning Engineering with Microsoft Azure, Microsoft certification as an Azure Data Scientist Associate, and a Data Science Professional Certificate from IBM.

ðŸ’¬ Experienced in:
Environmental engineering: water/wastewater treatment, solid waste management
Climate change & sustainability: greenhouse gas accounting & offset project management, sustainability reporting, community development
Occupational health & safety: AK3 Umum certified
Others: MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint

ðŸ’¬ Practical skills in:
Data science/analytics/visualization: Power BI, Tableau, Python, scikit-learn, D3.js
Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
Others: git and GitHub, PowerShell, bash, AWS, MS Azure

My extensive experience of working in an international environment and passion for learning foreign languages & cultures have also enhanced my intercultural sensitivity.

âš¡ When not at work, I'll be traveling with my family, learning new languages, reading, writing rap songs, or playing basketball.
